        ### NOTE: This method is hacky. It works for some objects, but has the following issues:
        ### 1. The robot doesn't know if it can successfully open the container
        ###    door (especially fridge).
        ### 2. An object, if placed very low, may be blocked by e.g. tabletop
        ###    and right now the robot cannot adjust its height to detect those
        ###    objects
        ### 3. (This is unrelated to this method, but it's an issue) For some
        ###    objects, their height seems wrong with respect to robot's height,
        ###    which causes the wrong pitch rotation to be computed

        ### which is approximately optimal (shortest), but it won't be able to
        ### execute it successfully 100% of the time because of the above issues.
